## Testing statistical graphics

Evaluate design choices and understand cognitive biases through the use of visual tests.

Could ask participants to:

- identify differences in graphs.
- read information off of a chart accurately.
- use data to make correct real-world decisions.
- predict the next few observations.

All of these types of tests require different levels of use and manipulation of the information presented in the chart.
