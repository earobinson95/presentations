# Testing Statistical Graphics

Evaluate design choices and understand cognitive biases through the use of **visual tests**. 

Could ask participants to:

`r emoji("graph")` identify differences in graphs.

`r emoji("book")` read information off of a chart accurately. 

`r emoji("international")` use data to make correct real-world decisions.

`r emoji("pencil2")` predict the next few observations.

Readers are asked to input their own assumptions about various metrics and compare how these assumptions relate to reality.

The New York Times team utilizes **Data Driven Documents (D3)** that allows readers to predict these metrics through the use of drawing a line on their computer screen with their mouse.

# Background of D3

**Who?** [Mike Bostock](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock) created D3 during his time working on graphics at the New York Times.
  
**What?** Open-source JavaScript based graphing framework
+ D3 = "Data Driven Documents"
+ `D3` is to JavaScript as `ggplot2` is to R
+ Framework for binding objects and layers to plotting area
  + framework for movement and user interaction

**When?** D3 v1.0 released in 2011, D3.js recently celebrated it's 10th anniversary!

**Where?** The internet!

**Why?** Advantages of using D3 include animation and allowing for movement and user interaction.

**How?** `r2d3`!

???

+ Used by major news and research organizations such as the New York Times, FiveThirtyEight, Washington Post, and the Pew Research Center create and customize graphics.
+ `D3` is to JavaScript as `ggplot2` is to R
+ Advantages include animation and allowing for movement and user interaction.

# Relationship between D3 and R 

.pull-left[
The `r2d3` package `r Citep(bib[[c("r2d3_pkg")]])` in R provides an efficient integration of D3 visuals and R by displaying them in familiar formats:
+ RMarkdown with HTML output
+ Shiny applications (amazing!)

].pull-right[
.center[

]
]

`r2d3` makes it easy to do your data processing in R, then apply D3.js code to visualize that data!

--
.pull-left[
**How?**
+ Converts data in R to JSON that can be interpreted by JavaScript
+ Sources D3 code library
+ Creates plot container (svg)
+ Renders plot using source code
].right-plot[
```{r r2d3-example, echo = T, eval = F}
r2d3(data = data,
     script = "d3-source-code.js",
     d3_version= "5")
```
]

???

A challenge of working with D3 is the environment necessary to display the graphics and images. 

The `r2d3` package in R provides an efficient integration of D3 visuals and R by displaying them in familiar formats:
+ RMarkdown with HTML output
+ Shiny applications (amazing!)

`r2d3` makes it easy to do your data processing in R, then apply D3.js code to visualize that data!

The example R code illustrates the structure of the r2d3 function which includes specification of a data frame in R (converted to a JSON file), the D3.js source code file, and the D3 version that accompanies the source code.
A default SVG (scalable vector graphic) container for layering elements is then generated by the r2d3 function which renders the plot using the source code.

# 'You Draw It' Task Plot

Prompt: *Use your mouse to fill in the trend in the yellow box region.*

**Test out your drawing skills at [emily-robinson.shinyapps.io/can-you-draw-it](https://emily-robinson.shinyapps.io/can-you-draw-it).**

???

Here we see an example of a you draw it interactive plot as seen by participants during the study. Participants are prompted to: "Use your mouse to fill in the trend in the yellow box region". The yellow box region moves along as the participant draws their trend-line until the yellow region disappears.
