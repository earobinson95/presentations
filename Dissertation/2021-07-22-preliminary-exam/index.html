# Introduction to Graphics

Data visualization is a central tool in modern data science and defined as the art of drawing **graphical charts** in order to display data (Unwin, 2020).

**What are graphics useful for?** (Lewandowsky &amp; Spence, 1989)
+ Data cleaning.
+ Exploring data structure.
+ Communicating information.

**Who uses graphics?**
+ Governments use graphics to understand population and economic interests (Harms, 1991; Playfair, 1801; Walker &amp; others, 2013).
+ Companies use graphics to understand mechanics and support business decisions (Chandar, Collier, &amp; Miranti, 2012; Yates, 1985).
+ News sources display graphics of weather forecasts to communicate critical information and aid in decision making.
+ Today, graphics are found in scientific publications and mass media (Aisch et al., 2016; Gouretski &amp; Koltermann, 2007; Silver, 2020).

# Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson, 2012)

.pull-left[
**Big Idea:** Graphics are built from the ground up by specifying exactly how to create a particular graph from a given data set.

Graphics are viewed as a mapping
+ **from variables** in the data set (or statistics computed from the data)
+ **to visual attributes** such as the axes, colors, shapes, or facets on the page/screen

].pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/graphic-flowchart.png" width="85%"/&gt;
(Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann, 2020)
]

???

+ The figure illustrates the process of creating a graphic from a data set through the use of variable mapping, data transformations, coordinate systems, and aesthetic features (Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann, 2020) 

+ Software, such as Hadley Wickham’s ggplot2 (Hadley Wickham, 2011), aims to implement the framework of creating charts and graphics as the grammar of graphics recommends.

# Perceptual Process

.pull-left[
The **perceptual process** is a sequence of steps used to describe a how a stimulus in the environment leads to our perception of the stimulus and action in response to the stimulus (Goldstein &amp; Brockmole, 2017).

+ **Sensation:** simple processes that occur right at the beginning of a
sensory system (Carlson, 2010) 
+ **Perception:** higher-order mechanisms and identified with more complex processes (Myers &amp; DeWall, 2021).
].pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/perceptual-process-goldsein-pg5.png" width="100%"/&gt;
]

???
+ In order to develop guiding principles for generating graphics effective in communication, we must first understand the basic mechanics of the human perceptual system and the biases we are vulnerable to (Goldstein &amp; Brockmole, 2017).

+ The perceptual process begins when there is a stimulus in the environment and
light is reflected and focused back into the viewer’s eyes. Within the eye, the light
reflected is transformed and focused by the eye’s optical system and an image is
formed on the receptors of the viewer’s retina. It is important to note that
everything a person perceives is based not on direct contact with stimuli but on
representations of stimuli that are formed on the receptors and the resulting activity
in the person’s nervous system. Once light is reflected and focused, our visual
receptors respond to the light and transform the light energy into electrical energy
through a process called transduction. Signals from the receptors are then
transmitted through the retina, to the brain, and then within the brain where
perception (what do you see?) and recognition (what is it called?) occur. After
recognition, viewers take some sort of motor action; for example, the viewer might
move closer to the object. The perceptual process is not direct and instead takes on
more of a cyclic nature where a person may go through many iterations of stimuli,
perception, recognition, and action before the final image is identified and
understood (M. A. Peterson, 1994).

# Perceptual Process

When perception occurs, we experience:
  + **preattentive stage** in which we observe color, shape, size, and other basic information about the stimuli being perceived.
  + **direct attention** is required for additional processing to allow us to draw connections between components that assist in our interpretation of the stimuli. 

&lt;!-- Graph interpretation involves: (Shah, Mayer, &amp; Hegarty, 1999) --&gt;
&lt;!-- + relatively simple pattern perception and association processes in which viewers can associate graphic patterns to quantitative referents --&gt;
&lt;!-- + more complex and error-prone inferential processes in which viewers must mentally transform data.  --&gt;
.pull-left[
When interacting with charts, a viewer must: (Shah &amp; Carpenter, 1995)
+ identifying meaningful visual features.
+ classify the quantitative measures and relationships.
+ translate to the variables defined in the data set.
]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/decreasing-population-1.png" width="80%" /&gt;
]

???

+ When viewing a chart or graph, most insights we gain are due to the cognitive processes that occur after attention is focused on specific aspects of the graph.

+ Shah &amp; Carpenter (1995) established the process in which viewers interact with charts by first observing the visual features and later translating to cognitive
processing of the information depicted by those features. 

+ The relationship between physiology and perception can provide us information
about how graphics may be understood and interpreted. Through experimentation,
the physiological response (automatic reaction) is related to the behavioral response
(perception, recognition, and action).

# Logarithmic Perception

Ernst Weber, an early psychophysics researcher discovered the relationship between the difference threshold (smallest detectable difference between two sensory stimuli; known as the “Just Noticeable Difference”) and the magnitude of a stimulus.

**Weber’s law** states we do not notice absolute changes in stimuli,
but instead that we notice the relative change (Fechner, 1860). Discovered by Ernst Weber, an early psychophysics researcher.

Numerically, Weber’s Law is defined as:

`\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta S}{S} = K
\end{equation*}`

+ `\(\Delta S\)` represents the difference threshold
+ `\(S\)` represents the initial stimulus
+ `\(K\)` is called Weber’s contrast which remains constant as the magnitude
of `\(S\)` changes.

class:primary
# Logarithmic Perception

Gustav Fechner, a founder of psychophysics, provided further
extension to Weber’s law by discovering the relationship between the perceived
intensity is logarithmic to the stimulus intensity when observed above a minimal
threshold of perception (Fechner, 1860).

Formally known as the **Weber-Fechner law**, it is derived from Weber’s law as:
`\begin{equation}
P = K \ln \frac{S}{S_0}
\end{equation}`
+ `\(P\)` represents the perceived stimulus
+ `\(K\)` represents Weber’s contrast
+ `\(S\)` represents the initial stimulus intensity
+ `\(S_0\)` represents the minimal threshold of perception.

# Testing Graphics

Evaluate design choices through the use of graphical tests. Could ask participants to:

- identify differences in graphs.
- read information off of a chart accurately.
- use data to make correct real-world decisions.
- predict the next few observations.

All of these types of tests require different levels of use and manipulation of the information presented in the chart.

# Motivation

Data visualizations played an important role in during the COVID-19 pandemic in displaying case counts, transmission rates, and outbreak regions (Rost, 2020).

  + Mass media routinely showed charts to share information with the public about the progression of the pandemic (Romano, Sotis, Dominioni, &amp; Guidi, 2020).
  + Graphics helped guide decision makers to implement policies such as shut-downs or mandated mask wearing.
  + Facilitated communication with the public to increase compliance (Bavel et al., 2020).

# Logarithmic Scales

When faced with data which spans several orders of magnitude, we must decide
whether to show the data on its original scale (compressing the smaller magnitudes
into relatively little area) or to transform the scale and alter the contextual
appearance of the data.

One common solution is to use a log scale transformation to display data over several orders of magnitude within one graph.

# Logarithmic Mapping

+ When we first learn to count, we begin counting by ones, then by tens, and advancing to hundreds, following the base10 order of magnitude system.

+ Research suggests our perception and mapping of numbers to a number line is logarithmic at first, but transitions to a linear scale later in development, with formal mathematics education (Dehaene, Izard, Spelke, &amp; Pica, 2008; Siegler &amp; Braithwaite, 2017, 2017; Varshney &amp; Sun, 2013).

.center[
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/log-number-line-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;
]

+ A kindergartner asked to place numbers one through ten along a number
line would place three close to the middle, following the logarithmic perspective
(Varshney &amp; Sun, 2013)

+ Assuming there is a direct relationship between perceptual and cognitive
processes, it is reasonable to assume numerical representations should also be
displayed on a nonlinear, compressed number scale. Therefore, if we perceive
logarithmically by default, it is a natural (and presumably low effort) way to display
information and should be easy to read and understand/use.

# Underestimation of Exponential Growth

.pull-left[
Exponential growth is often misjudged:
+ early stage appears to have a small growth rate
+ middle stage appears to be growing, but not at an astounding rate, appearing more quadratic.
+ late stages exponential growth when it is quite apparent
].pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/exponential-stages-comic.jpg" width="100%"/&gt;
]

This misinterpretation can lead to decisions made under inaccurate understanding causing future consequences.

Estimation and prediction of exponential growth and is underestimated when presented both numerically and graphically (Jones, 1977; Mackinnon &amp;
Wearing, 1991; Wagenaar &amp; Sagaria, 1975).

Our inability to accurately predict exponential growth might also be addressed by log transforming the data, however, this transformation introduces new complexities; most readers are not mathematically sophisticated enough to intuitively understand logarithmic math and translate that back into real-world effects.

???
Results indicated that numerical
estimation is more accurate than graphical estimation for exponential curves.
Experimental studies were conducted in order to determine strategies to improve
the accuracy of estimation of exponential growth (Jones, 1977; Mackinnon &amp;
Wearing, 1991; Wagenaar &amp; Sagaria, 1975). There was no improvement in
estimation found when participants had contextual knowledge or experience with
exponential growth, but instruction on exponential growth reduced the
underestimation; participants adjusted their initial starting value but not their
perception of the growth rate (Jones, 1977; Wagenaar &amp; Sagaria, 1975). Mackinnon
&amp; Wearing (1991) found that estimation was improved by providing immediate
feedback to participants about the accuracy of their current predictions.

# Data Driven Documents (D3.js)


+ **What?** D3 is an open-source JavaScript based graphing framework created by Mike Bostock during his time working on graphics at the New York Times.
  + D3 is to JavaScript as ggplot2 is to R. 
  
Similar to geometric objects and style choices in ggplot2, the grammar of D3 also includes elements such as circles, paths, and rectangles with choices of attributes and styles such as color and size.

+ **How?** Depends on Extensible Markup Language (XML) to generate graphics and images by binding objects and layers to the plotting area as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) in order to preserve the shapes rather than the pixels.

+ **Why?** Advantages of using D3 include animation and allowing for movement and user interaction such as hovering, clicking, and brushing. 

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/raster-vs-vector.png" alt="SVG vs Raster" width="50%" /&gt;

+ Used by major news and research organizations such as the New York Times, FiveThirtyEight, Washington Post, and the Pew Research Center create and customize graphics.
+ In June 2020, the New York Times released a front page displaying figures that represent each of the 100,000 lives lost from the COVID-19 pandemic until this point in time [@NYTrememberinglives]; this visualization was meant to bring about a visceral reaction and resonate with readers.

# r2d3

A challenge of working with D3 is the environment necessary to display the graphics and images. 
The r2d3 package in R provides an efficient integration of D3 visuals and R by displaying them in familiar HTML output formats such as RMarkdown or Shiny applications [@r2d3].
The creator of the graphic applies D3.js source code to visualize data which has previously been processed within an R setting. 

The example R code illustrates the structure of the r2d3 function which includes specification of a data frame in R (converted to a JSON file), the D3.js source code file, and the D3 version that accompanies the source code.
A default SVG container for layering elements is then generated by the r2d3 function which renders the plot using the source code. 
[Appendix A](#youdrawit-with-shiny) outlines the development of the you draw interactive plots used in this study through the use of r2d3 and R shiny applications. 
\cref{fig:youdrawit-example} provides an example of a you draw it interactive plot as seen by participants during the study. 
The first frame shows what the participant sees along with the prompt, "Use your mouse to fill in the trend in the yellow box region". 
Next, the yellow box region moves along as the participant draws their trend-line until the yellow region disappears, indicating the participant has filled in the entire domain.

# Data Simulation

&lt;!-- + `\(N = 30\)` points `\((x_i, y_i), i = 1,...N\)` were generated for `\(x_i \in [x_{min}, x_{max}]\)` --&gt;
Data were simulated based on linear model with additive errors: 
`\begin{equation}
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + e_i
\end{equation}`

where `\(e_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2).\)`

Where `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)` are selected to replicate Mosteller et al. (1981) with `\(e_i\)` generated by rejection sampling in order to guarantee the points shown align with that of the fitted line. 

An ordinary least squares regression is then fit to the simulated points in order to obtain the best fit line and fitted values in 0.25 increments across the domain, `\((x_k, \hat y_{k,OLS}), k = 1, ..., 4 x_{max} +1\)`.
The data simulation function then outputs a list of point data and line data both indicating the parameter identification, x-value, and corresponding simulated or fitted y value.

Simulated model equation parameters were selected to reflect the four data sets (F, N, S, and V) used in Mosteller et al. (1981).
+ **F:** positive slope; a large variance; `\(x \in [0, 20]\)`. 
+ **N:** negative slope; large variance; `\(x \in [0, 20]\)`. 
+ **S:** positive slope; small variance; `\(x \in [0, 20]\)`. 
+ **V:** steep positive slope; small variance; `\(x \in [4, 16]\)`.

Aesthetic design choices were made consistent across each of the interactive you draw it plots:
aspect ratio, defining the `\(x\)` to `\(y\)` axis ratio was set to one y-axis range extended `\(10%\)` beyond (above and below) the range of the simulated data points to allow for users to draw outside the simulated data set range.

# Slope of First Principal Component

&lt;!-- In addition to the participant drawn points, `\((x_k, y_{k,drawn})\)`, and the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression fitted values, `\((x_k, \hat y_{k,OLS})\)`, a regression equation with a slope based on the first principal component (PCA) was used to calculate fitted values, `\((x_k, \hat y_{k,PCA})\)`. --&gt;
&lt;!-- For each set of simulated data and parameter choice, the PCA regression equation was determined by using the princomp function in the stats package in base R to obtain the rotation of the coordinate axes from the first principal component (direction which captures the most variance). --&gt;
&lt;!-- The estimated slope, `\(\hat\beta_{1,PCA}\)`, is determined by the ratio of the axis rotation in y and axis rotation in x of the first principal component with the y-intercept, `\(\hat\beta_{0,PCA}\)` calculated by the point-slope equation of a line using the mean of of the simulated points, `\((\bar x_i, \bar y_i)\)`. --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;!-- \rh{Please explain x-rotation and y-rotation of PC1. Maybe the first paragraph of section 3.3.2 could be extended.} --&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- Fitted values, `\(\hat y_{k,PCA}\)` are then obtained every 0.25 increment across the domain from the PCA regression equation, `\(\hat y_{k,PCA} = \hat\beta_{0,PCA} + \hat\beta_{1,PCA} x_k\)`. --&gt;
&lt;!-- \cref{fig:ols-vs-pca-example} illustrates the difference between an OLS regression equation which minimizes the vertical distance of points from the line and a regression equation with a slope calculated by the first principal component which minimizes the smallest distance of points from the line. --&gt;

# Linear Mixed Model (LMM)

Using the lmer function in the lme4 package, a linear mixed model (LMM) is fit separately to the OLS and PCA residuals, constraining the fit to a linear trend. 

The LMM equation for each fit (OLS and PCA) residuals is given by:
`\begin{equation}
e_{ijk,fit} = \left[\gamma_0 + \alpha_i\right] + \left[\gamma_{1} x_{ijk} + \gamma_{2i} x_{ijk}\right] + p_{j} + \epsilon_{ijk}
\end{equation}`
where

+ `\(e_{ijk,fit}\)` is the residual between the drawn and fitted y-values for the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice, `\(j^{th}\)` participant, and `\(k^{th}\)` increment of x-value corresponding to either the OLS or PCA fit
+ `\(\gamma_0\)` is the overall intercept
+ `\(\alpha_i\)` is the effect of the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice (F, S, V, N) on the intercept
+ `\(\gamma_1\)` is the overall slope for `\(x\)`
+ `\(\gamma_{2i}\)` is the effect of the parameter choice on the slope
+ `\(x_{ijk}\)` is the x-value for the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice, `\(j^{th}\)` participant, and `\(k^{th}\)` increment
+ `\(p_{j} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{participant})\)` is the random error due to the `\(j^{th}\)` participant's characteristics
+ `\(\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)` is the residual error.

# Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM)

Eliminating the linear trend constraint, the `bam` function in the mgcv package is used to fit a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) separately to the OLS and PCA residuals to allow for estimation of smoothing splines.

The GAMM equation for each fit (OLS and PCA) residuals is given by:
`\begin{equation}
e_{ijk,fit} = \alpha_i + s_{i}(x_{ijk}) + p_{j} + s_{j}(x_{ijk})
\end{equation}`
where

+ `\(e_{ijk,fit}\)` is the residual between the drawn and fitted y-values for the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice, `\(j^{th}\)` participant, and `\(k^{th}\)` increment of x-value corresponding to either the OLS or PCA fit
+ `\(\alpha_i\)` is the intercept for the parameter choice `\(i\)`
+ `\(s_{i}\)` is the smoothing spline for the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice
+ `\(x_{ijk}\)` is the x-value for the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice, `\(j^{th}\)` participant, and `\(k^{th}\)` increment
+ `\(p_{j} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{participant})\)` is the error due to participant variation
+ `\(s_{j}\)` is the random smoothing spline for each participant.

# Sum of Squares Analysis

Sums of squares between the OLS residuals and PCA residuals were compared using the lmer function in the `lme4` package in R to run a linear mixed model (LMM) with a log transformation.

Define `\(SS_{ijk}\)` as the sums of squares for parameter choice `\(i = 1,2,3,4\)`, fit `\(j=1,2\)`, and participant `\(k = 1,...,N_{participant}\)`.

The LMM equation is given by: 
&lt;!-- \rh{in equation 3.4, have epsilon ijk, and on page 56 too.} --&gt;
`\begin{equation}
\log\left(SS_{ijk}\right) = \alpha_i + \beta_j + \alpha\beta_{ij} + p_{j} + \epsilon_{ijk}
\end{equation}`

+ `\(\alpha_i\)` denotes the effect of the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice
+ `\(\beta_j\)` denotes the effect of the `\(j^{th}\)` fit
+ `\(\alpha\beta_{ij}\)` denotes the interaction between the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice and `\(j^{th}\)` fit
+ `\(p_{j} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{participant})\)` is the random error due to the `\(k^{th}\)` participant's characteristics
+ `\(\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)` is the residual error.

# Conclusion

Examining the plots, the estimated trends of PCA residuals (orange) appear to align closer to the `\(y=0\)` horizontal (dashed) line than the OLS residuals (blue). 
In particular, this trend is more prominent in parameter choices with large variances (F and N).
These results are consistent to those found in @mosteller_eye_1981 indicating participants fit a trend line closer to the estimated regression line with the slope of the first principal component than the estimated OLS regression line.

While there is no significant effect of fit for any parameter choices, there is indication of the trend found previously in the residual regression models indicating that participants tend to fit the slope of the first principal component over the slope of the ordinary least squares regression line, particularly for trends with large variation (parameter choices N and F). 

The intent of this chapter was to establish you draw it as a tool for testing graphics then use this tool to determine the cognitive implications of displaying data on the log scale.
Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era replicated the results found in Mosteller et al. (1981). 
When shown points following a linear trend, participants tended to fit the slope of the first principal component over the slope of the least squares regression line.
This trend was most prominent when shown data simulated with larger variances. 
The reproducibility of these results serve as evidence of the reliability of the you draw it method.

# Data Simulation

&lt;!-- All data processing was conducted in R before being passed to the D3.js source code.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- A total of `\(N = 30\)` points `\((x_i, y_i), i = 1,...N\)` were generated for `\(x_i\in [x_{min}, x_{max}]\)` where `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` have an exponential relationship. --&gt;
Data were simulated based on a one parameter exponential model with multiplicative errors:
`\begin{equation}
y_i = e^{\beta x_i + e_i}
\end{equation} 
with `\(e_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2).\)`
+ `\(\beta\)`, determines the rate of exponential growth
+ `\(e_i\)` generated by rejection sampling in order to guarantee the points shown align with that of the fitted line displayed in the initial plot frame. 
A nonlinear least squares regression is then fit to the simulated points in order to obtain the best fit line and fitted values in 0.25 increments across the domain, `\((x_m, \hat y_{m,NLS}), k = 1, ..., 4 x_{max} +1\)`.

class:primary 
# Treatment Design

Each growth rate parameter was used to simulate data across a domain of 0 to 20.
The two simulated data sets (low and high exponential growth rates) were then shown four times each by truncating the points shown at both `\(50%\)` and `\(75%\)` of the domain as well as on both the log and linear scales for a total of eight interactive plots reflecting a factorial treatment design. 

Aesthetic design choices were made consistent across each of the interactive you draw it plots; the aspect ratio, defining the `\(x\)` to `\(y\)` axis ratio was set to one, the y-axis extended `\(50%\)` below the lower limit of the simulated data range and `\(200%\)` beyond the upper limit of the simulated data range to allow for users to draw outside the data set range, and participants were asked to start drawing at `\(50%\)` of the domain (for example, at `\(x = 10\)`).
Reflecting the treatment design for each plot, the y-axis was assigned to be displayed on either the linear scale or log scale.
