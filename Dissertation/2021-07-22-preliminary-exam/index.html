Thank you, everyone for coming! Today, I will be presenting my research on the human perception of exponentially increasing data displayed on a log scale evaluated through experimental graphics tasks as part of my Ph.D. prelims. This work has been conducted under the supervision of Dr. Susan VanderPlas and Dr. Reka Howard. 

First, I will provide some background on graphics and logarithmic scales and give an overview of my research objectives. This presentation will mainly focus on the second graphical task study, Prediction with you draw it and then I will share future work to be done.

# Introduction to Graphics

Data visualization is defined as the art of drawing **graphical charts** in order to display data (Unwin, 2020).

**What are graphics useful for?** (Lewandowsky and Spence, 1989)
+ Data cleaning.
+ Exploring data structure.
+ Communicating information.

**Who uses graphics?**
+ Governments (Harms, 1991; Playfair, 1801; Walker, 2013).
+ Companies (Chandar, Collier, and Miranti, 2012; Yates, 1985).
+ News sources and mass media (Aisch, Cohn, Cox, et al., 2016).
+ Scientific publications (Gouretski and Koltermann, 2007).

???

To get started, we are first going to lay the foundation of graphics. Data visualization has become central tool in modern data science and statistics. Unwin 2020 defines data visualization as the art of drawing graphical charts in order to display data.

Graphics are useful for data cleaning, exploring data structure, and communicating information. While working at the consulting desk, one of the first things I do when I receive a clients data is to plot the raw data points they have given me. This often leads to the detection of typos when recording data and guides discussion with the client in order to clarify their research questions. After an analysis has been conducted, I then use charts and graphs to display the results and find this is more effective at helping them with interpretation. 

In the 18th and 19th century, governments began using graphics to understand population and economic interests. In the 20th century, we saw companies using graphics to understand the inner workings of their business and support their business decision. We often see news source displaying graphics of weather forecasts such as hurricane trajectories. Today, we see graphics everywhere from scientific journals to mass media in the newspapers, TV, and internet.

Despite the popularity of graphics, we are too accepting of them as default without asking critical questions about the graphics we create or view (Unwin, 2020). 
+ **How effective is this graph at communicating useful information?** (Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann, 2020)
+ An effective graphic accurately shows the data through the appropriate chart selection, axes and scales, and aesthetic design choices in order to successfully communicate the intended result.

Higher quality of technology has influenced the creation, replication, and
complexity of graphics. We now have an infinitely many number design choices:
+ variables displayed, type of graphic, size of graphic, aspect ratio, colors, symbols, scales, limits, ordering of categorical variables
+ increasing number of design choices `\(\implies\)` consistent themes and higher standards.

There is a need for an established set of concepts and terminology to build their graphics from so they can actively choose which of many possible graphics to draw in order to ensure their charts are effective at communicating the intended result.

# Grammar of Graphics

Graphics are build from the ground up by specifying exactly how to create a particular graph from a given data set.

Graphics are viewed as a mapping
+ **from variables** in the data set (or statistics computed from the data) 
+ **to visual attributes** such as the axes, colors, shapes, or facets on the page/screen

The figure illustrates the process of creating a graphic from a data set through the use of variable mapping, data transformations, coordinate systems, and aesthetic features (Vanderplas, Cook, &amp; Hofmann, 2020) 

Software, such as Hadley Wickham’s ggplot2 (Hadley Wickham, 2011), aims to implement the framework of creating charts and graphics as the grammar of graphics recommends.

# Perceptual Process

+ Direct attention
]

???
+ In order to develop guiding principles for generating graphics effective in communication, we must first understand the basic mechanics of the human perceptual system and the biases we are vulnerable to (Goldstein &amp; Brockmole, 2017).

+ The **perceptual process** is a sequence of steps used to describe a how a stimulus in the environment leads to our perception of the stimulus and action in response to the stimulus
(Goldstein and Brockmole, 2016).


+ The perceptual process begins when there is a stimulus in the environment and
light is reflected and focused back into the viewer’s eyes. Within the eye, the light
reflected is transformed and focused by the eye’s optical system and an image is
formed on the receptors of the viewer’s retina. It is important to note that
everything a person perceives is based not on direct contact with stimuli but on
representations of stimuli that are formed on the receptors and the resulting activity
in the person’s nervous system. Once light is reflected and focused, our visual
receptors respond to the light and transform the light energy into electrical energy
through a process called transduction. Signals from the receptors are then
transmitted through the retina, to the brain, and then within the brain where
perception (what do you see?) and recognition (what is it called?) occur. After
recognition, viewers take some sort of motor action; for example, the viewer might
move closer to the object. The perceptual process is not direct and instead takes on
more of a cyclic nature where a person may go through many iterations of stimuli,
perception, recognition, and action before the final image is identified and
understood (M. A. Peterson, 1994).

**Sensation:** simple processes that occur right at the beginning of a
sensory system (Carlson, 2010).

**Perception:** higher-order mechanisms and identified with more complex processes (Myers and DeWall, 2021).
+ preattentive stage in which we observe color, shape, size, and other basic information about the stimuli being perceived.
+ direct attention is required for additional processing to allow us to draw connections between components that assist in our interpretation of the stimuli. 

+ When viewing a chart or graph, most insights we gain are due to the cognitive processes that occur after attention is focused on specific aspects of the graph.

+ The relationship between physiology and perception can provide us information about how graphics may be understood and interpreted. Through experimentation, the physiological response (automatic reaction) is related to the behavioral response (perception, recognition, and action).

# Logarithmic Perception

**Weber’s law** states we do not notice absolute changes in stimuli,
but instead that we notice the relative change (Fechner, 1860). Numerically:

`\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta S}{S} = K
\end{equation*}`

+ `\(\Delta S\)` represents the difference threshold
+ `\(S\)` represents the initial stimulus
+ `\(K\)` is called Weber’s contrast which remains constant as the magnitude
of `\(S\)` changes. 

???
Ernst Weber, an early psychophysics researcher discovered the relationship between the difference threshold (smallest detectable difference between two sensory stimuli; known as the “Just Noticeable Difference”) and the magnitude of a stimulus.

---
class:primary
# Logarithmic Perception

**Weber-Fechner law** states the relationship between the perceived intensity is logarithmic to the stimulus intensity when observed above a minimal threshold of perception (Fechner, 1860). Derived from Weber’s law:
`\begin{equation}
P = K \ln \frac{S}{S_0}
\end{equation}`
+ `\(P\)` represents the perceived stimulus
+ `\(K\)` represents Weber’s contrast
+ `\(S\)` represents the initial stimulus intensity
+ `\(S_0\)` represents the minimal threshold of perception.

???
Gustav Fechner, a founder of psychophysics, provided further extension to Weber’s law by discovering the relationship between the perceived intensity is logarithmic to the stimulus intensity when observed above a minimal threshold of perception (Fechner, 1860).

# Testing Graphics

Evaluate design choices through the use of graphical tests. Could ask participants to:

- identify differences in graphs.
- read information off of a chart accurately.
- use data to make correct real-world decisions.
- predict the next few observations.

All of these types of tests require different levels of use and manipulation of the information presented in the chart.

+ Problem: Data which sapns several orders of magnitude shown on its original scale compresses the smaller magnitudes into relatively little area.
+ Solution: Use of a log scale transformation; alters the contextual appearance of the data.
+ The usefulness of the log scale in science is illustrated showing the challenge of displaying the fuel energy density of Uranium along side other sources of fuel due to differences in magnitude of density.

# Logarithmic Mapping

Our perception is **logarithmic at first**, but transitions to a **linear scale later** in development (Dehaene, Izard, Spelke, et al., 2008; Siegler and Braithwaite, 2017; Varshney and Sun, 2013).

.center[
&lt;img src="images/log-numberline.png" width="100%"/&gt;
]

**Assumption:** If we perceive logarithmically by default, it is a natural way to display information and should be easy to read and understand/use.

???

+ When we first learn to count, we begin counting by ones, then by tens, and advancing to hundreds, following the base10 order of magnitude system.

Our perception and mapping of numbers to a number line is **logarithmic at first**, but transitions to a **linear scale later** in development, with formal mathematics education (Dehaene, Izard, Spelke, et al., 2008; Siegler and Braithwaite, 2017; Varshney and Sun, 2013).

+ A kindergartner asked to place numbers one through ten along a number
line would place three close to the middle, following the logarithmic perspective
(Varshney and Sun, 2013).

+ Assuming there is a direct relationship between perceptual and cognitive
processes, it is reasonable to assume numerical representations should also be
displayed on a nonlinear, compressed number scale. Therefore, if we perceive
logarithmically by default, it is a natural (and presumably low effort) way to display
information and should be easy to read and understand/use.

**Benefits** were seen in spring 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

+ Large magnitude discrepancies in case counts at a given time point between different geographic regions.
+ Log scale transformations were usefulness for showing case count curves for areas with few cases and areas with many cases within one chart. 

**Pitfalls** were exposed as the pandemic evolved, and the case counts were no longer spreading exponentially.

+ Graphs with linear scales seemed more effective at spotting early increases in case counts that signaled more localized outbreaks.
+ The effect of the linear scale appears to evoke a stronger reaction from the public than the log scale.

# Underestimation of Exponential Growth

.center[
&lt;img src="images/exponential-stages-comic.jpg", width="85%"/&gt;

(Von
Bergmann, 2021)
]

???
Exponential growth is often misjudged:
+ **early stage** appears to have a small growth rate.
+ **middle stage** appears to be growing, but not at an astounding rate, appearing more quadratic.
+ **late stages** exponential growth when it is quite apparent.

This misinterpretation can lead to decisions made under inaccurate understanding causing future consequences.

# Underestimation of Exponential Growth

Estimation and prediction of **exponential growth is underestimated** when presented both numerically and graphically (Jones, 1979; Mackinnon and Wearing, 1991; Wagenaar and Sagaria, 1975).

**Can log transforming the data help?**

+ Maybe, but are there consequences? 
+ Most readers are not mathematically sophisticated enough to intuitively understand logarithmic math and translate that back into real-world effects.

???

Estimation and prediction of **exponential growth is underestimated** when presented both numerically and graphically (Jones, 1979; Mackinnon and Wearing, 1991; Wagenaar and Sagaria, 1975).

+ Numerical estimation is more accurate than graphical estimation for exponential curves.
+ No improvement in estimation found when participants had contextual knowledge or experience with exponential growth.
+ Instruction on exponential growth reduced the underestimation (Jones, 1979; Wagenaar and Sagaria, 1975). 
+ Estimation was improved by providing immediate feedback to participants about the accuracy of their current predictions (Mackinnon and Wearing, 1991).

+ **Big Idea:** Students fitted lines by eye to four sets of points.
+ **Method:** 8.5 x 11 inch transparency with a straight line etched across the middle.
+ **Sample:** 153 graduate students and post docs in Introductory Biostatistics.
+ **Experimental Design:** Latin square.
+ **Findings:** Students tended to fit the slope of the first principal component.

+ Method involves maneuvering a string, black thread, or ruler until the fit seems satisfactory, and then drawing the line.
+ Sample - most had not studied statistics before
+ Method proposed by Tukey
+ Students tended to fit the slope of the first principal component or major axis (the line that minimizes the sum of squares of perpendicular rather than vertical distances).
+ Students had a slight tendency to choose consistently either steeper or shallower slopes for all sets of data.
+ Individual-to-individual variability in slope and in intercept was near the standard error provided by least squares for the four data sets (no theory encourages us to believe in such relations).
+ Found no trend in the differences due to order.

# Background of D3

**Who?** [Mike Bostock](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock) created D3 during his time working on graphics at the New York Times.
  
**What?** Open-source JavaScript based graphing framework
+ D3 = "Data Driven Documents"
+ `D3` is to JavaScript as `ggplot2` is to R
+ Framework for binding objects and layers to plotting area
  + framework for movement and user interaction

**When?** D3 v1.0 released in 2011, D3.js recently celebrated it's 10th anniversary!

**Where?** The internet!

**Why?** Advantages of using D3 include animation and allowing for movement and user interaction such as hovering, clicking, and brushing. 

**How?** `r2d3`!



???

+ Used by major news and research organizations such as the New York Times, FiveThirtyEight, Washington Post, and the Pew Research Center create and customize graphics.
+ In June 2020, the New York Times released a front page displaying figures that represent each of the 100,000 lives lost from the COVID-19 pandemic until this point in time [@NYTrememberinglives]; this visualization was meant to bring about a visceral reaction and resonate with readers. 
+ During 2021 March Madness, FiveThirtyEight created a roster-shuffling machine which allowed readers to build their own NBA contender through interactivity [@ryanabest_2021].
+ Similar to geometric objects and style choices in ggplot2, the grammar of D3 also includes elements such as circles, paths, and rectangles with choices of attributes and styles such as color and size.

`r2d3` makes it easy to do your data processing in R, then apply D3.js code to visualize that data!

--
&lt;!-- The example R code illustrates the structure of the r2d3 function which includes specification of a data frame in R (converted to a JSON file), the D3.js source code file, and the D3 version that accompanies the source code. --&gt;
&lt;!-- A default SVG container for layering elements is then generated by the r2d3 function which renders the plot using the source code.  --&gt;
.pull-left[
**How?**
+ Converts data in R to JSON that can be interpreted by JavaScript
+ Sources D3 code library
+ Creates plot container (svg)
+ Renders plot using source code

```r
r2d3(data = data,
     script = "d3-source-code.js",

???
A challenge of working with D3 is the environment necessary to display the graphics and images. 

+ Converts data in R to JSON that can be interpreted by JavaScript
  + Object is named 'data'
  + Columns can be accessed
+ Sources D3 code library
  + Grabs version specified in function
+ Creates plot container (svg is default)
  + Or different container if specified
  + specifies width and height of plot container
+ Renders plot object using JavaScript and CSS files called in r2d3 call

+ `\(\alpha_i\)` is the effect of the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice (F, S, V, N) on the intercept
+ `\(\gamma_1\)` is the overall slope for `\(x\)`
+ `\(\gamma_{2i}\)` is the effect of the parameter choice on the slope
+ `\(x_{ijk}\)` is the x-value for the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice, `\(j^{th}\)` participant, and `\(k^{th}\)` increment
+ `\(p_{j} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{participant})\)` is the random error due to the `\(j^{th}\)` participant's characteristics
+ `\(\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)` is the residual error.

Using the `lmer` function in the lme4 package, a linear mixed model (LMM) is fit separately to the OLS and PCA residuals, constraining the fit to a linear trend.

# Generalized Additive Mixed Model
The GAMM equation for each fit (OLS and PCA) residuals is given by:
`\begin{equation}
e_{ijk,fit} = \alpha_i + s_{i}(x_{ijk}) + p_{j} + s_{j}(x_{ijk})
\end{equation}`
where

+ `\(e_{ijk,fit}\)` is the residual between the drawn and fitted y-values for the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice, `\(j^{th}\)` participant, and `\(k^{th}\)` increment of x-value corresponding to either the OLS or PCA fit
+ `\(\alpha_i\)` is the intercept for the parameter choice `\(i\)`
+ `\(s_{i}\)` is the smoothing spline for the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice
+ `\(x_{ijk}\)` is the x-value for the `\(i^{th}\)` parameter choice, `\(j^{th}\)` participant, and `\(k^{th}\)` increment
+ `\(p_{j} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{participant})\)` is the error due to participant variation
+ `\(s_{j}\)` is the random smoothing spline for each participant.

Eliminating the linear trend constraint, the `bam` function in the mgcv package is used to fit a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) separately to the OLS and PCA residuals to allow for estimation of smoothing splines.

For each participant, the final data set used for analysis contains:
+ `\(x_{ijklm}\)`, `\(y_{ijklm,drawn}\)`, and `\(\hat y_{ijklm,NLS}\)`  

for:
+ growth rate `\(i = 1,2\)`,

+ scale `\(k = 1,2\)`,
+ participant  `\(l = 1,...N_{participant}\)`, and 
+ `\(x_{ijklm}\)` value `\(m = 1, ...,4 x_{max} + 1\)`.

Vertical residuals between the drawn and fitted values were calculated as:

# Generalized Additive Mixed Model

The GAMM equation for residuals is given by:
`\begin{equation}
e_{ijklm,nls} = \tau_{ijk} + s_{ijk}(x_{ijklm}) + p_{l} + s_{l}(x_{ijklm})
\end{equation}`

where

+ `\(e_{ijklm,NLS}\)` is the residual between the drawn y-value and fitted y-value for the `\(l^{th}\)` participant, `\(m^{th}\)` increment, and `\(ijk^{th}\)` treatment combination 
+ `\(\tau_{ijk}\)` is the intercept for the `\(i^{th}\)` growth rate, `\(j^{th}\)` point truncation, and `\(k^{th}\)` scale treatment combination
+ `\(s_{ijk}\)` is the smoothing spline for the `\(ijk^{th}\)` treatment combination
+ `\(x_{ijklm}\)` is the x-value for the `\(l^{th}\)` participant, `\(m^{th}\)` increment, and `\(ijk^{th}\)` treatment combination 
+ `\(p_{l} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{participant})\)` is the error due to the `\(l^{th}\)` participant's characteristics 
+ `\(s_{l}\)` is the random smoothing spline for the `\(l^{th}\)` participant.

???
Allowing for flexibility, the bam function in the mgcv package is used to fit a GAMM to estimate trends of vertical residuals from the participant drawn line in relation to the NLS fitted values.

# GAMM Results
.center[
&lt;img src="images/exp-gamm-plot.png" width="80%"/&gt;
]

???
Predictions made on the **linear scale** (blue) deviate from the  `\(y=0\)` horizontal (dashed) line `\(\implies\)` **underestimation** of exponential growth.

Predictions made on the **log scale** (orange) follow closely to the `\(y=0\)` horizontal (dashed) line `\(\implies\)` **more accurate** than trends predicted on the linear scale.

More prominent in high exponential growth rates.

Underestimation begins after the aid of points is removed.

# Conclusion

**Goal:** Test an individual's ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data.

**Results:**
+ Predictions made on the log scale were more accurate than those made on the linear scale. 
+ Strongly supported for high exponential growth rates.
+ Points shown along the trend improve predictions.

**The results of this study suggest that there are cognitive advantages to log scales when making predictions of exponential trends.**

???
  + Indicated by the discrepancy in results for treatments with points truncated at `\(50\%\)` compared to `\(75\%\)` of the domain. 
  
Further investigation is necessary to determine the implications of using log scales when translating exponential graphs to numerical values.

# Research Objectives

**Big Idea:** Are there benefits to displaying exponentially increasing data on a log scale rather than a linear scale?

1. [Perception through Lineups](https://shiny.srvanderplas.com/log-study/) 📈 📈 📈

    - Test an individuals ability to perceptually differentiate exponentially increasing data with differing rates of change on both the linear and log scale.
    
2. [Prediction with You Draw It](https://shiny.srvanderplas.com/you-draw-it/) ✏️
    
    - Tests an individuals ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data.
        + Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era
        + Prediction of Exponentially Increasing Trends
        
3. **Estimation by Numerical Translation** 📏

    - **Tests an individuals ability to translate a graph of exponentially increasing data into real value quantities.**

# Phrasing of Estimation Questions

Spence (1990) presents four example questions for comparing the sizes of individual graphical elements:
+ **How much greater** was the rainfall in September than May? 
  + `\(\implies\)` *estimate numeric change*
+ Is the price of oil in constant dollars **increasing or decreasing** from year to year? 
  + `\(\implies\)` *determine increasing or decreasing*
+ **Do more** people subscribe **to** Time **than** Newsweek? 
  + `\(\implies\)` *determine yes or no*
+ **Did** the ABC Corporation pay the largest dividends last year, **or** did XYZ? 
  + `\(\implies\)` *determine ABC or XYZ*

# Research Objectives

**Big Idea:** Are there benefits to displaying exponentially increasing data on a log scale rather than a linear scale?

1. [**Perception through Lineups**](https://shiny.srvanderplas.com/log-study/) 📈 📈 📈

    - **Test an individuals ability to perceptually differentiate exponentially increasing data with differing rates of change on both the linear and log scale.**
    
2. [Prediction with You Draw It](https://shiny.srvanderplas.com/you-draw-it/) ✏️
    
    - Tests an individuals ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data.
        
3. Estimation by Numerical Translation 📏

    - Tests an individuals ability to translate a graph of exponentially increasing data into real value quantities.

# Study Design

**Curvature:**
+ High Curvature
+ Medium  Curvature
+  Low Curvature

**Treatment Design:** Target Panel gets model A and Null Panels get model B

`\(3!\cdot 2!= 6\)` curvature combinations

`\(\times 2\)` lineup data sets per combination `\(=\)` **12 test data sets**

`\(\times 2\)` scales (log &amp; linear) `\(=\)` **24 different lineup plots**

**Experimental Design:** 13 lineup plots per participant

`\(6\)` test parameter combinations per participant `\(\times 2\)` scales `\(= 12\)` test lineups

`\(1\)` rorschach parameter combination per participant

# Generalized Linear Mixed Model

Define `\(Y_{ijkl}\)` to be the event that participant `\(l\)` correctly identifies the target plot for data set `\(k\)` with curvature `\(j\)` plotted on scale `\(i\)`.

`$$\text{logit }P(Y_{ijk}) = \eta + \delta_i + \gamma_j + \delta \gamma_{ij} + s_l + d_k$$`
where
- `\(\eta\)` is the beaseline average probability of selecting the target plot. 
- `\(\delta_i\)` is the effect of the log/linear scale.
- `\(\gamma_j\)` is the effect of the curvature combination.
- `\(\delta\gamma_{ij}\)`is the two-way interaction effect of the scale and curvature.
- `\(s_l \sim N(0,\sigma^2_\text{participant})\)`, random effect for participant characteristics.
- `\(d_k \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{\text{data}})\)`, random effect for data specific characteristics. 

We assume that random effects for data set and participant are independent.

???
Each lineup plot evaluated was assigned a value based on the participant response (correct = 1, not correct = 0). The binary response was analyzed using generalized linear mixed model following a binomial distribution with a logit link function.

# Results

&lt;img src="images/lineup-results.png" width="100%"/&gt;
]

???
+ The choice of scale has no impact if curvature differences are
large. 

+ Presenting data on the log scale makes us more sensitive to the the changes when there are only slight changes in curvature.

+ An exception occurs when identifying a plot with more curvature than the surrounding plots, indicating that it is is more difficult to say something has less curvature, but easy to say that something has more curvature (Best, Smith, and Stubbs, 2007).
