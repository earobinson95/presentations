## Conclusions

- The flight does not follow a linear relationship, most of the moths are captured in the middle of the flight with a few stragglers at the beginning and end.
- Based on the latent means:
  - Concord and North Platte tend to have later start dates.
  - Aurora has a shorter flight and Clay Center tends to have a longer flight.
- Based on the latent variances:
  - North Platte tends to have a more variable start date.
- The total moths for that flight are negatively associated with the start date and positively associated to the length of the flight.
- The peak moths are positively associated with the start date and for some locations, negatively associated with the length.
- According to farmers, the flight in North Platte has been lasting later in the season, based on the time series plot, we can see that the start date has been later and the length of the flight has been increasing over the most recent years.

- Daily weather (e.g. number of days until consistent Growing Degree Days)
- AR(1) Structure
- Sine/Cosine Nonlinear Fit
