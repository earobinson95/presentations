# Presentations

Hi, I'm Emily! This repository contains all things presentation related. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics at University of Nebraska - Lincoln. My research interests involve experimental design and perception and decision making using graphics. I am passionate about communicating statistics and look forward to meeting you!
