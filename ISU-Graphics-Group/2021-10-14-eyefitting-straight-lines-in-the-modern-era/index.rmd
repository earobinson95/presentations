# Introduction to Graphics

Data visualization is defined as the art of drawing **graphical charts** in order to display data `r Citep(bib[[c("unwin2020data")]])`.

**What are graphics useful for?** `r Citep(bib[[c("lewandowsky1989perception")]])`

`r emo::ji("graph")` Data cleaning.

`r emo::ji("magnifying")` Exploring data structure. 

`r emo::ji("bubble")` Communicating information.

**Who uses graphics?**
+ Governments `r Citep(bib[[c("harms1991august", "playfair1801statistical", "walker2013statistical")]])`.
+ Companies `r Citep(bib[[c("chandar2012graph", "yates1985graphs")]])`.
+ News sources and mass media `r Citep(bib[[c("Aisch_NYTimes_presidential_forecast")]])`.
+ Scientific publications `r Citep(bib[[c("gouretski2007much")]])`.

???
To get started, we are first going to lay the foundation of graphics. Data visualization has become central tool in modern data science and statistics. Unwin 2020 defines data visualization as the art of drawing graphical charts in order to display data.

Graphics are useful for data cleaning, exploring data structure, and communicating information.

In the 18th and 19th century, governments began using graphics to understand population and economic interests. In the 20th century, we saw companies using graphics to understand the inner workings of their business and support their business decision. We often see news source displaying graphics of weather forecasts such as hurricane trajectories. Today, we see graphics everywhere from scientific journals to mass media in the newspapers, TV, and internet.

Despite the popularity of graphics, we are too accepting of them as default without asking critical questions about the graphics we create or view (Unwin, 2020). We must begin asking ourselves **How effective is this graph at communicating useful information?**

Higher quality of technology has influenced the creation, replication, and complexity of graphics. We now have an infinitely many number design choices:
+ variables displayed, type of graphic, size of graphic, aspect ratio, colors, symbols, scales, limits, ordering of categorical variables

There is a need for an established set of concepts and terminology to build their graphics from so they can actively choose which of many possible graphics to draw in order to ensure their charts are effective at communicating the intended result.

# Testing Statistical Graphics

Evaluate design choices and understand cognitive biases through the use of **visual tests**. 

Could ask participants to:

`r emo::ji("graph")` identify differences in graphs.

`r emo::ji("book")` read information off of a chart accurately. 

`r emo::ji("international")` use data to make correct real-world decisions.

`r emo::ji("pencil2")` predict the next few observations.

???
One way we can evaluate these design choices through the use of graphical tests. 

Could ask participants to:

- identify differences in graphs.
- read information off of a chart accurately.
- use data to make correct real-world decisions.
- predict the next few observations.

All of these types of tests require different levels of use and manipulation of the information presented in the chart.

# Lineup Protocol

.pull-left[
Introduced in `r Citet(bib[[c("buja2009statistical")]])`.

Embed a *target plot* (actual data) in a set of *null plots* (data generated under the null distribution).

].pull-right[
```{r results='asis', echo = F, include = T, cache = F, eval = TRUE}
i1 <- img_modal(src = "images/lineup-protocol.png", alt = " ", other=list(width="100%"))

c(str_split(i1, "\\n", simplify = T)[1:2],
  str_split(i1, "\\n", simplify = T)[3:9]
  ) %>% paste(collapse = "\n") %>% cat()
```
]

???
Efforts in the field of graphics have developed graphical testing tools and methods such as the lineup protocol to provide a framework for inferential testing.

When inspecting a plot, how do we know if what we are seeing is actually there? One way of answering this question is to embed the true data plot (called target plot) into a set of randomly permuted data sets (called null plots). This is what we call a lineup.

This is similar to the law-enforcement procedure to line up a suspect among a set of innocents to check if a victim can identify the suspect as the perpetrator of the crime.

Here, visual evaluation of the lineup is conducted by a person. If the viewers detect the target plot, we can conclude the plots are distinguishable.

The lineup protocol is one such example of the development of tools designed for statistical graphical testing. The advancement of graphing software provides the tools necessary to develop new methods of testing graphics.

# Linear Regression 

The principle of simple linear regression is to find the line (i.e., determine its equation) which passes as close as possible to the observations, that is, the set of points.

```{r linear-regression, echo = F, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 9/2, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(plyr)

set.seed(2)
corrCoef = 0.5 # sample from a multivariate normal, 10 datapoints
dat = MASS::mvrnorm(10,c(0,0),Sigma = matrix(c(1,corrCoef,2,corrCoef),2,2))
dat[,1] = dat[,1] - mean(dat[,1]) # it makes life easier for the princomp
dat[,2] = dat[,2] - mean(dat[,2])

dat = data.frame(x1 = dat[,1],x2 = dat[,2])

dat %>%
ggplot(aes(x1,x2))+
  geom_point()+
  coord_equal()+
  scale_x_continuous("x") +
  scale_y_continuous("y") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1,
        legend.position = "none",
        axis.text    = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title   = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.key.size = unit(1, "line")
        )
```

**Big Idea:** How do statistical regression results compare to intuitive, visually fitted results?

???
We are going to focus on two regression lines determined by ordinary least squares regression and regression based on the principal axis. The figure illustrates the difference between an OLS regression line which minimizes the vertical distance of points from the line and a regression line based on the principal axis (Principal Component) which minimizes the Euclidean distance of points (orthogonal) from the line. This is what we refer to as “ensemble perception” indicating the visual system can compute averages of various features in parallel across the items in a set (in this case, over the x and y-axes).

I want to introduce a study conducted in 1981 called Eye Fitting Straight Lines by Mosteller et al. In this study:

+ Students fitted lines by eye to four sets of points.
+ 8.5 x 11 inch transparency with a straight line etched across the middle.
+ 153 graduate students and post docs in Introductory Biostatistics.
+ Latin square.
+ Students tended to fit the slope of the first principal component or major axis (the line that minimizes the sum of squares of perpendicular rather than vertical distances).

Here we see an example of a "You Draw It" task plot used in the study. Participants are prompted to "Use your mouse to fill in the trend in the yellow box region. The yellow box region moves along as the participant draws their trend-line until the yellow region disappears." 

Task plots were created using Data Driven Documents (D3), a JavaScript-based graphing framework that facilitates user interaction. We then integrate this into RShiny using the r2d3 package.

# Data Generation

.pull-left[

$N = 30$ points $(x_i, y_i), i = 1,...N$ were generated for $x_i \in [x_{min}, x_{max}]$.

Data were simulated based on linear model with additive errors:
\begin{equation}
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + e_i
\end{equation}

where $e_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2).$

Parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ were selected to reflect the four data sets used in `r Citet(bib[[c("mosteller1981eye")]])`.

].pull-right[
```{r results='asis', echo = F, include = T, cache = F, eval = TRUE}

???

Data were generated following a linear model with additive errors. 

Model equation parameters, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, were selected to reflect the four data sets (F, N, S, and V) used in Mosteller et al. (1981). 

+ **S:** positive slope; small variance; $x \in [0, 20]$. 
+ **F:** positive slope; a large variance; $x \in [0, 20]$.  
+ **V:** steep positive slope; small variance; $x \in [4, 16]$. 
+ **N:** negative slope; large variance; $x \in [0, 20]$.

for

**Vertical residuals** between the drawn and fitted values were calculated as:

+ $e_{ijk,PCA} = y_{ijk,drawn} - \hat y_{ijk,PCA}$.

???
We compare the participant drawn line to two regression lines determined by ordinary least squares regression and regression based on the principal axis. The figure illustrates the difference between an OLS regression line which minimizes the vertical distance of points from the line and a regression line based on the principal axis (Principal Component) which minimizes the Euclidean distance of points (orthogonal) from the line.

Here we see an example of the feedback data from one you draw it plot. For 0.25 increments across the domain, we have the participant drawn values, the fitted values from the ordinary least squares regression, and the fitted values from the regression based on the principal axis. 

We are mainly interested in the deviation of the participant drawn line from the fitted regression lines. So while it seems counter-intuitive, the residual actually becomes our response in this case.

# Linear Trend Constraint
The **Linear Mixed Model** equation for each fit (OLS and PCA) residuals is given by:
\begin{equation}
e_{ijk,fit} = \left[\gamma_0 + \alpha_i\right] + \left[\gamma_{1} x_{ijk} + \gamma_{2i} x_{ijk}\right] + p_{j} + \epsilon_{ijk}
\end{equation}
where

+ $e_{ijk,fit}$ is the residual between the drawn and fitted y-values for the $i^{th}$ parameter choice, $j^{th}$ participant, and $k^{th}$ increment of x-value corresponding to either the OLS or PCA fit
+ $\gamma_0$ is the overall intercept
+ $\alpha_i$ is the effect of the $i^{th}$ parameter choice (F, S, V, N) on the intercept
+ $\gamma_1$ is the overall slope for $x$
+ $\gamma_{2i}$ is the effect of the parameter choice on the slope
+ $x_{ijk}$ is the x-value for the $i^{th}$ parameter choice, $j^{th}$ participant, and $k^{th}$ increment
+ $p_{j} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{participant})$ is the random error due to the $j^{th}$ participant's characteristics
+ $\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ is the residual error.

???

Using the `lmer` function in the lme4 package, a linear mixed model (LMM) is fit separately to the OLS and PCA residuals, constraining the fit to a linear trend.

Results indicate the estimated trends of PCA residuals (orange) appear to align closer to the y = 0 horizontal (dashed) line than the OLS residuals (blue). In particular, this trend is more prominent in parameter choices with large variances (F and N). These results are consistent to those found in Mosteller
et al. (1981) indicating participants fit a trend-line closer to the estimated regression line with the slope of based on the first principal axis than the estimated OLS regression line.

# Smoothing Spline Trend
The **Generalized Additive Mixed Model** equation for each fit (OLS and PCA) residuals is given by:
\begin{equation}
e_{ijk,fit} = \alpha_i + s_{i}(x_{ijk}) + p_{j} + s_{j}(x_{ijk})
\end{equation}
where 

+ $e_{ijk,fit}$ is the residual between the drawn and fitted y-values for the $i^{th}$ parameter choice, $j^{th}$ participant, and $k^{th}$ increment of x-value corresponding to either the OLS or PCA fit
+ $\alpha_i$ is the intercept for the parameter choice $i$
+ $s_{i}$ is the smoothing spline for the $i^{th}$ parameter choice
+ $x_{ijk}$ is the x-value for the $i^{th}$ parameter choice, $j^{th}$ participant, and $k^{th}$ increment
+ $p_{j} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{participant})$ is the error due to participant variation
+ $s_{j}$ is the random smoothing spline for each participant.

???

Eliminating the linear trend constraint, the `bam` function in the mgcv package is used to fit a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) separately to the OLS and PCA residuals to allow for estimation of smoothing splines.

# Smoothing Spline Trend

???
The results of the GAMM align with those in the linear constraint trend providing support that for scatter-plots with more noise (F and N), estimated trends of PCA residuals (orange) appear to align closer to the y = 0 horizontal (dashed) line than the OLS residuals (blue). However, By fitting smoothing splines, we can determine whether participants naturally fit a straight trend-line to the set of points or whether they deviate throughout the domain providing us with further insight into the curvature humans perceive in a set of points.

**Results:**
+ Estimated drawn trend-lines followed closer to the principal axes than the OLS regression line.
+ Most prominent in data simulated with large variances.
+ Humans perform “ensemble perception” in a statistical graphic setting as participants minimized the distance from the their regression line over both the x and y axis simultaneously

This study reinforces the differences between intuitive visual model fitting and statistical model fitting, providing information about human perception as it relates to the use of statistical graphics.

**The reproducibility of these results serve as validation of the 'You Draw It' tool and method.**
