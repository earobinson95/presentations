## Student Success

- Met with Dr. Tiffany Heng-Moss (Dean of CASNR)
- Sense of Belonging:
  - Sense of belonging: A sense of belonging is “a basic human need and motivation, sufficient to influence behavior. In terms of college, sense of belonging refers to students’ perceived social support on campus, a feeling or sensation of connectedness, the experience of mattering or feeling cared about, accepted, respected, valued by, and important to the group (e.g., campus community) or others on campus (e.g., faculty, peers).” (Strayhorn, 2012, p. 3)
  - There are many reasons that sense of belonging matters within higher education. Two key areas are retention and persistence and mental health.
  - Do first-year students experience peer belonging and institutional acceptance differently by socio-demographic student characteristics (race or ethnicity, parental education, or gender)?
  - Are students’ sense of peer belonging and institutional acceptance positively accepted by first-year participation in HIPs (research with faculty, service learning, learning community, and student leadership)?
- Matriculation Success (i.e. time to graduation)
  - Survival modeling
- Retention Rates

## P.O.W.E.R Survey

- P.O.W.E.R Survey (Purpose, Ownership, Wellness, Engagement, Relationships)
  - Sent to all UNL Freshman in the fourth week of the Fall 2019 semeseter (1788 responses, 38.3% response rate)
  - 11 Binary Questions 
  - Outreach to Res Life, Student Inolvement, Big Red Resilience, Office of Academic Success &amp; intercultural Services (OASIS), First-Year Experience and Transition Programs (FYETP), Husker Hub, University Advising

## Student Demographic Data
- Academic Management Information System (AMIS Database) [https://iea.unl.edu/]
  - Snapshot of UNL's data taken each semeseter (Fall, Spring, Summer)
  - *e.g. age, gender, first time freshman, honors, first gen, athlete, scholarship athlete, resident status, full time or part time, college, degree, department, AP credit, ACT test, HS GPA, transfer student, sections enrolled, final GPA, 2nd year college, 3rd year college, degree in number of years, term graduated, etc.*
  
- National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) Survey [http://nsse.indiana.edu/]
  - Five levels: Level of academic challenge, active and collaborative learning, student-faculty interaction, enriching educational experiences, and supportive campus environment.
  - UNL participated in the NSSE in 2007, 2010, 2011 (Pilot study), 2012 (Pilot study), 2013, 2016 [response rate: 27% for freshman &amp; 23% for seniors), and 2019 [HIP’s, Inclusiveness and Engagement with Cultural Diversity, Association of American Universities Data Exchange - AAUDE] [https://www.unl.edu/nsse/]

## Past Studies &amp; Overarching Themes

- Strayhorn (2012) developed a model for sense of belonging within higher education that is similar to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. 
  - See his `\(\text{Ted}^\text{X}\)` talk, "Inalienable Rights: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Belonging: Terrell Strayhorn at TEDxColumbus" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak6T9kw0H28 
  
- Astin’s (1991) input-environment-outcome (I-E-O) model: inputs should describe qualities of the student prior to being exposed to the college environment and exposure to the environment is known to precede the assessment of the outcome performance.
- A students’ sense of belonging declines over the course of an academic year.
- Race / Ethnicity are important predictors.
- First Generation students are impacted.
- Student involvement / High Impact Practices.

## Introduction to Visual Inference

1. Data plots `\(\equiv\)` test statistics

2. Plots of data generated from a null hypothesis (e.g. bootstrapping) using a lineup.
3. A lineup contians one "guilty" plot randomly placed among a field of "innocent" or null plots.
4. If the null hypothesis is true then the plot of the data will not be distinguishable
from the plots of null data.

5. Viewers asked to identify the plot that is the most different.

6.  If the viewer identifies the suspect, it lends statistical significance to the conclusion that the data is not consistent with the null data.

7. Implement study with Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowd sourcing website.
8. Using a Binomial Distriution, expect to see the "guilty" plot selected `\(\frac{1}{\text{Number of Plots}}\)` times by random chance.

- Think 218 with simulated p-values in Chapters 5 and 6.

## Past Visual Inference Studies

- Evaluating competting designs (e.g. Polar Charts vs Barcharts)

- Applications to linear models (and LMM's)
  - Inferential testing
  - Diagnostics (e.g. Q-Q Plots)
  
- Graphical tasks and the association with certain visual skills

- The effect of preceptual principles

- Using image similarity to evaluate the discriminability of a data visualization

- Possible distortions of visualizations (e.g. gaps, outliers, spikes, etc.)

- **Many of the studies implement some sort of experimental design (e.g. fractional factorial, incomplete block design, etc.) in the Amazon Mechanical Turk to collect data.**

## Future Thoughts
- I have found that I enjoy spending my time on:
  - Experimental Design
  - Communicating Statistics (e.g. Consulting and Teaching)
  - Data Science
  - Nonlinear Analysis
  - Structural Equation Modleing (SEM)
  
- Considerations with Sense of Belonging:
  - Reliability &amp; validity of survey.
  - The survey is binary.
  - The questions target different aspects of a student's sense of belonging, can we tie them all together with psychometrics to come up with one measure?
  
- Possible directions:
  - Combine visual inference and survey data (item response theroy - IRT).
  - Detecting bias due to missing data (or correcting for non-response rates)
  - Mainstream visual inference into consulting practices.
  - Model evaluation / diagnostics of GLMM, Nonlinear Models, and Nonlinear Mixed models using Visual Inference

## Impossible and Insane Idea
- Blumenstock, J., Cadamuro, G., &amp; On, R. (2015). Predicting poverty and wealth from mobile phone metadata. Science, 350(6264), 1073–1076. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aac4420

- Accurate and timely estimates of population characteristics are a critical input to social
and economic research and policy. In industrialized economies, novel sources of data are
enabling new approaches to demographic profiling, but in developing countries, fewer
sources of big data exist. We show that **an individual’s past history of mobile phone use can
be used to infer his or her socioeconomic status**. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
**predicted attributes of millions of individuals can, in turn, accurately reconstruct the
distribution of wealth of an entire nation or to infer the asset distribution of microregions
composed of just a few households**. In resource-constrained environments where censuses
and household surveys are rare, this approach creates an option for gathering localized
and timely information at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.
